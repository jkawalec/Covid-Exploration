### Covid-Project

I explored Covid data in SQL. I looked at the deaths and death rates for different places around the world. I also looked at the Vaccination statuses around the world.
The goal of this project was to explore this Covid dataset to find interesting information about it. I wanted to learn what affect the Vaccine status has on the death counts 
for the countries. I was also interested to see what affect population had on cases and deaths for each location.
